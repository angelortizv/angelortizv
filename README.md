# Angelo Ortiz Vega
> Computer Engineer | AI & Data, Full Stack Development | University Lecturer

**Software Engineer and AI Practitioner** with over four years of experience designing and building scalable, efficient, and data-driven digital products for startups and organizations. I combine strong technical expertise with problem-solving skills, business insight, and a user-centered mindset. Experienced in Python development with frameworks such as Flask and FastAPI, cloud integrations with AWS (S3, EC2, Lambda), and modern full stack technologies including React, Angular, and Node.js. My work often involves integrating Artificial Intelligence into production environments — from developing and deploying machine learning models to automating complex workflows and optimizing system performance. Currently completing a degree in Computer Engineering at the Technological Institute of Costa Rica, reinforcing a solid theoretical and analytical foundation in software systems and intelligent computing. In parallel, I have worked as a university lecturer for over three years, teaching Artificial Intelligence, Data Analysis, Full Stack Development, and UX Design, with a focus on hands-on, real-world applications that bridge technology and human experience.

Proudly Costa Rican. 🇨🇷
